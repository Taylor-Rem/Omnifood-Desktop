# Omnifood-Desktop
This project was an imitation for future projects. None of the links inside the project work, but the HTML and CSS was all written from scratch. This project was meant to teach me design principles, become more familiar with CSS display types like flex and grid, and taught me the importance of classes, subclasses, psuedoclasses etc.
